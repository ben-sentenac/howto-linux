## üñ• What is a Terminal?

The **terminal** is a text-based interface that allows you to interact with the operating system. It provides a window where you can input commands, which are then executed by the underlying shell.  

Common terminal applications:
- **GNOME Terminal** (Ubuntu, Fedora)
- **Konsole** (KDE environments)
- **xterm**
- **Alacritty**

## üêö What is a Shell?

The **shell** is the program that processes commands entered in the terminal and communicates with the operating system. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the system.

### Popular Shells
1. **Bash** (Bourne Again Shell) ‚Äì The default shell in many Linux distributions.
2. **Zsh** ‚Äì An advanced shell with better customization and features.
3. **Fish** ‚Äì A user-friendly shell with autosuggestions.
4. **Dash** ‚Äì A lightweight shell often used in scripts.

To check your current shell:
```bash
echo $SHELL
```
